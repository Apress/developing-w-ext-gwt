Developing with Ext GWT: Enterprise RIA Development
===================================================

Hi, contained in this zip file is the source code used within the book.

Before you begin, you should probably know these things...

1) Each folder (ie /Chapter03) is an Eclipse project.

2) You must copy in the resources from GXT in the ../war/gxt folder

Cheers,
Grant
